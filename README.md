# Assignment: Build a Basic Recipe Website

### Objective:
Apply and reinforce your HTML skills by creating a simple recipe website. This project aims to provide hands-on practice in structuring web content using HTML.

### Task:
Build a basic recipe website with the following specifications:

- Main Index Page:
  The main page should serve as the entry point to your recipe collection.
  Include links to a few recipes that users can navigate to.

- Recipe Pages:
  Create individual HTML pages for each recipe linked from the main index.
  Include relevant information such as ingredients, instructions, and any additional details you find appropriate.

- Aesthetic Considerations:
  While the primary focus is on HTML, feel free to add minimal styling if you wish.
  The project does not emphasize visual appeal at this stage, but you can experiment with basic styling if you're interested.
